        <p>
            <strong>Algorithm</strong>: A series of logical instructions designed to solve a problem or complete a specific task. <br><br>
            <strong>Big data</strong>: Extremely large datasets that can be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially in healthcare <br><br>
            <strong>Cancer</strong>: A disease where cells in the body grow uncontrollably, potentially forming tumors and affecting organs. <br><br>
            <strong>Database</strong>:  An organized system for storing and managing large amounts of information, such as those used in deep learning for analyzing medical data <br><br>
            <strong>Deep Learning</strong>:  A more complex branch of machine learning, allowing machines to learn autonomously and improve over time without human intervention, for example, detecting cancerous cells in medical images. <br><br>
            <strong>Machine Learning</strong>: A type of algorithm that enables machines to learn from data and make predictions, such as detecting signs of cancer in medical images. <br><br>
            <strong>Prevention</strong>: Actions taken to reduce the risk of diseases, like cancer, by analyzing medical data or changing lifestyle habits. <br><br>
            <strong>Sybil</strong>: An algorithm developed by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT, used to predict lung cancer risk with high accuracy. <br><br>
