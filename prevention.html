        <h2>How Algorithms can prevent cancerous cells ?</h2>
        <p>Let’s look at how algorithms help in preventing it. Prevention is a key aspect of fighting cancer, and algorithms play a crucial role here as well. 
            <br><br>    
            For instance, AI-powered tools can analyze large amounts of data from patients' medical records, lifestyle habits, and genetic information to assess individual cancer risks. These insights help doctors recommend personalized prevention strategies, such as regular screenings or lifestyle changes, to reduce the likelihood of developing cancer. 
            <br><br>
            One remarkable example is 'Sybil,' an algorithm developed by Massachusetts General Hospital and MIT. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., often detected too late for effective treatment. Sybil can predict lung cancer risk with up to 94% accuracy by analyzing CT scans and identifying patterns invisible to the human eye. In one case, it flagged a suspicious area in a patient’s lungs, and two years later, cancer developed exactly in that spot. This ability to predict cancer early is a game-changer for prevention. 
            <br><br>
            AI also offers significant advantages in terms of saving time and money. Algorithms can quickly process vast datasets, streamlining cancer screening processes and making them more efficient. However, there are still challenges, such as the need for large, high-quality datasets and concerns about accessing sensitive patient data.
            <br><br>
            While AI has its limitations, its potential to revolutionize cancer prevention is undeniable. Together with early detection, prevention ensures we are one step ahead in the fight against this disease.</p>
